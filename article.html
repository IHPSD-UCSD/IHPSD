          <h3>Question:<h3>
            <p>
              If quantim computers become a widespread stable technololgy will there be any way to protect our communications with encryption? Will we just have to resign ourselves to the fact that people would be listening in on us?
            </p>

                  post-quantum cryptography, and it refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. 
                  More specifically, the problem with the currently popular algorithms is when their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorisation problem, the discrete logarithm problem, or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.

                PQC revolves around at least 6 approaches. Note that some currently used symmetric key ciphers are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
                quantum key distribution, uses quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication. It enables two parties to construct a shared secret, which can then be used to establish confidentiality in a communication channel. QKD has the unique property that it can detect tampering from a third party -- if a third party wants to observe a quantum system, it will thus collapse some qubits in a superposition, leading to detectable anomalies. QKD relies on the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics instead of the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems
                Both these subfields are quite old.

              <p>
                People were thinking about the coming of quantum computing since the early 1970s, and thus much progress has already been made in this area. 
                It is unlikely that we'll have to give up communication privacy and confidentiality because of advances in quantum computation.
